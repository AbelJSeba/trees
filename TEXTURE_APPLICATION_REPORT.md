# Florasynth Tree Texture Application Error Report

## Issue Summary
When attempting to apply custom textures to the Florasynth-generated tree, we encountered critical WebGL vertex buffer corruption that prevented proper rendering.

## Texture Application Method
We attempted to apply textures using the Florasynth library's built-in texture system:

```javascript
// Load texture files
const barkTexture = textureLoader.load('/textures/bark.jpg');
const foliageTexture = textureLoader.load('/textures/foliage.jpg');

// Apply textures using Florasynth's method
FLORASYNTH.Tree.applyTextures(meshes, {
  bark: barkTexture,
  foliage: foliageTexture
});
```

## Assets Used
- **Bark Texture**: `public/textures/bark.jpg` - Brown wood bark texture
- **Foliage Texture**: `public/textures/foliage.jpg` - Green leaf texture

## Error Manifestation
1. **WebGL Buffer Corruption**: The `applyTextures()` method corrupted vertex buffer data
2. **Rendering Failure**: Tree meshes either disappeared or rendered incorrectly
3. **Browser Console Errors**: WebGL context errors related to corrupted vertex attributes
4. **Performance Degradation**: Severe frame rate drops during texture application

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue appears to be within the Florasynth library itself:
- The `FLORASYNTH.Tree.applyTextures()` method modifies vertex buffer data in a way that corrupts the WebGL state
- This is likely a bug in the Florasynth library's texture mapping implementation
- The library may be incorrectly handling vertex attribute arrays when applying UV coordinates

## Current Solution
We reverted to using Florasynth's default materials:
```javascript
// Skip texture application - use default black and white materials
console.log('Using default black and white materials');
// FLORASYNTH.Tree.applyTextures() - COMMENTED OUT DUE TO BUFFER CORRUPTION
```

## Alternative Approaches Considered
1. **Manual Material Assignment**: Directly assigning textures to mesh materials (not attempted due to Florasynth's internal structure)
2. **Post-Processing Textures**: Applying textures after mesh generation (would require deep understanding of Florasynth's mesh structure)
3. **Custom Shader Materials**: Replacing Florasynth materials entirely (significant development overhead)

## Recommendations
1. **Contact Florasynth Developers**: Report the buffer corruption bug in `applyTextures()` method
2. **Version Check**: Investigate if newer versions of Florasynth have resolved this issue
3. **Alternative Texture Library**: Consider using a different procedural tree generation library with stable texture support
4. **Custom Implementation**: If textures are critical, implement custom texture mapping outside of Florasynth's built-in system

## Current Status
- Tree renders successfully with default black and white materials
- Interactive rotation and scaling work properly
- WebGL performance is stable without texture application
- Component is production-ready in its current state
